## General Pull Request (PR) Guideline

1. **Create an Issue:**
   - Start by creating an issue that outlines the changes you plan to make. This helps facilitate discussion and approval for your proposed changes.

2. **Fork and Clone the Repository:**
   - Fork the repository you want to contribute to on GitHub.
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

3. **Create a Branch:**
   - Create a new branch for your changes. Naming conventions often follow the issue you're addressing or the feature you're implementing.
   - Use `git checkout -b branch-name` to create and switch to the new branch.

4. **Work on the Changes:**
   - Implement your desired changes, adhering to coding standards and best practices.
   - Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages, with each commit representing a logical unit of work.

5. **Push Changes to Your Fork:**
   - Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using `git push origin branch-name`.

6. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Navigate to the original repository and click "New Pull Request."
   - Select the base branch (usually `main` or `master`) and your branch for comparison.
   - Provide a concise and informative title and description for your PR, and reference any related issues.

7. **Submit the PR:**
   - Submit the PR, which will be reviewed by project maintainers or collaborators.
   - Be prepared to address feedback and make necessary revisions.

8. **PR Approval and Merging:**
   - Once your PR is approved, you can either merge it yourself (if you have permissions) or wait for a maintainer to merge it.
   - Consider squashing your commits into a single, meaningful commit with a descriptive message before merging.

9. **Clean Up:**
   - After merging, delete the branch both locally and in your GitHub fork.

Remember to adhere to the project's specific contribution guidelines and coding standards. Clear and meaningful titles and commit messages are crucial for understanding the purpose of your changes, both in the PR and in the commit history.
